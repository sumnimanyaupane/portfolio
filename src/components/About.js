            Hi, I'm Sumnima Nyaupane. I have an understanding of the relationship
            between design and users through detailed execution and proper user experience.
            I love working on interesting and meaningful projects that I can be proud of,
            and I always strive to create clean, pixelated interfaces that are smoothly animated.
            I prioritize not only code but also quality, perfect design, and optimized development.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>
    </section>
